### Description ###
A console python application that searches for file(s) in Windows based on the string input using The breadth first search algorithm. The boundary of the search is limited only to the selected parent folder to search and its sub-folders . Each folder will act as the node of the "graph", as the pointer from algorithm searches for the matching file(s). Allows specific file search or file name search. The algorithm's process of shifting nodes from OPEN to CLOSED variables are also displayed in the result.
